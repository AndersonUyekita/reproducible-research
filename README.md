#### Course Description

> In this course you will learn the ideas of reproducible research and
> reporting of statistical analyses. Topics covered include literate
> programming tools, evidence-based data analysis, and organizing data
> analyses. In this course you will learn to write a document using R
> markdown, integrate live R code into a literate statistical program,
> compile R markdown documents using knitr and related tools, publish
> reproducible documents to the web, and organize a data analysis so
> that it is reproducible and accessible to others.

#### Course Syllabus

-   Structuring and organizing a data analysis
-   Markdown and R Markdown
-   knitr / RPubs
-   Reproducible research check list
-   Evidence-based data analysis
-   Case studies in air pollution epidemiology and high-throughput
    biology

#### Course Textbook

The book [📔 Report Writing for Data Science in
R](./book/report-writing-for-data-science-in-r.pdf) covers the lecture
material in this course.

#### Course Projects

> The Course Projects focus on plotting and will be assessed via peer
> assessment. In these assignments, you will be asked to conduct data
> analysis and you will be evaluated by your classmates on the work and
> code that you write. Assignments evaluated via peer assessment will
> make use of your GitHub account or the RPubs web site.
