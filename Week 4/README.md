## Class Notes

### [<kbd>Lesson 1</kbd>](#lesson-1) Caching Computations

The `cacher` package is no longer available on CRAN.

-   <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cacher/index.html>

<!-- -->

    Package ‘cacher’ was removed from the CRAN repository.

    Formerly available versions can be obtained from the archive.

    Archived on 2014-09-19 as vignette locations were never updated for R 3.1.0.

    Please use the canonical form https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cacher to link to this page.

### [<kbd>Lesson 1</kbd>](#lesson-2) Case Study: Air Pollution

**Lessons Learned**

-   Reproducibility of NMMAPS allowed for a secondary analysis (and
    linking with PM chemical constituent data) investigating a novel
    hypothesis (Lippmann et al.)
-   Reproducibility also allowed for a critique of that new analysis and
    some additional new analysis (Dominici et al.)
-   Original hypothesis not necessarily invalidated, but evidence not as
    strong as originally suggested (more work should be done)
-   Reproducibility allows for the scientific discussion to occur in a
    timely and informed manner
-   This is how science works

### [<kbd>Lesson 1</kbd>](#lesson-3) Case Study: High Throughput Biology

Lecture about how to create reproducible research.
