#### Description

> This week will cover the basic ideas of reproducible research since
> they may be unfamiliar to some of you. We also cover structuring and
> organizing a data analysis to help make it more reproducible. I
> recommend that you watch the videos in the order that they are listed
> on the web page, but watching the videos out of order isn’t going to
> ruin the story.

## Class Notes

### [<kbd>Lesson 1</kbd>](#lesson-1) Concepts and Ideas

Replication: Based on an experiment, I will try to do it using my data
following a third party’s instructions (computer code).

Reproduction: I will use the same dataset and computer code to get the
same results.

**Summary**

-   Reproducible research is important as a minimum standard,
    particularly for studies that are difficult to replicate  
-   Infrastructure is needed for creating and distributing reproducible
    documents, beyond what is currently available  
-   There is a growing number of tools for creating reproducible
    documents

### [<kbd>Lesson 2</kbd>](#lesson-2) Structure of a Data Analysis

Steps in a data analysis Steps in a data analysis

-   Define the question
-   Define the ideal data set
-   Determine what data you can access
-   Obtain the data
-   Clean the data
-   Exploratory data analysis
-   Statistical prediction/modeling
-   Interpret results
-   Challenge results
-   Synthesize/write up results
-   Create reproducible code

### [<kbd>Lesson 3</kbd>](#lesson-3) Organizing Your Analysis

Data analysis files

**Summary**

-   Data
    -   Raw data
    -   Processed data (it should be tidy)
-   Figures
    -   Exploratory figures
    -   Final figures
-   R code
    -   Raw / unused scripts
    -   Final scripts
    -   R Markdown files
-   Text
    -   README files
    -   Text of analysis / report
